## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I came back on classic CSS to challenge me a bit. And that was the case. The hard things were the banner for the differents devices. And I discover the background-blend-mode property to done the footer.

I think it's easier to start in desktop-first developement for this project. But I did the mobile-first developement (I'm crazy).

I tried to do this project fast to move on the javascript language programming section in Frontend Mentor Website.

I will refactorize the code in the future, I don't want to spend to much time on it, I want to keep moving forward.

### Continued development

I'll use more pseudo-elements like ::before and ::after. I'll practice more project with position property. And try to size most of my content with width and height. These concepts need to be practice to be perfect.
